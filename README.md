***Problem Statement:***

You are tasked with building an account overview and transaction management application. The application should consist of two main screens:
1. Account Overview Screen:
    * This screen will display the user's opening and closing balances for the past three months, derived from the data provided by an API endpoint that returns a list of transactions.
2. Transaction Screen:
    * From the account overview screen, users should be able to navigate to the transaction screen where a detailed list of transactions is displayed.
    * This screen should have the following additional features:
        * A dropdown menu for filtering transactions by type.
        * A search field where users can input keywords to filter transactions based on their query.
     

We have already finished the basic setup and implemented some of the boilerplate code.
- `NavGraph` is for hosting the Jetpack navigation
- An account overview screen is created which is `AccountOverviewScreen` with ViewModel
- A transaction screen is created which is `TransactionScreen` with ViewModel

***Requirements:***
* **Architecture**: Follow an architecture such as **MVI** or **MVVM** for the implementation.
* **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests, primarily for testing the ViewModel.
* **Asynchronous** Programming: Use Coroutines and Flows for managing asynchronous tasks and data flow.
* **Performance**: Optimize the application for fast and efficient performance.
* **Readability**: Ensure the code is easy to understand and follow.
* **Maintainability**: The code should be organized in a way that allows easy future updates and modifications.
* **Testability**: Design the app to be easily testable, with clear separation of concerns.
* **Scalability**: Ensure the app can scale easily if new features or transaction data types are added.
* **Simplicity**: Keep the design and implementation as simple as possible while fulfilling all the functional requirements.
  
**Notes:**
- Please feel free to use the internet but **not any AI tools**.
- Create a branch from the main branch and name it "**develop-(name)**", add as many as commits you want and after finishing the development please push your changes.
- Feel free to ask us anything
